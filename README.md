# dir-assistant

Chat with your current directory's files using a local or API LLM.

![(Demo GIF of dir-assistant being run)](demo.gif)

Dir-assistant has local platform support for CPU (OpenBLAS), Cuda, ROCm, Metal, Vulkan, and SYCL.

Dir-assistant has API support for all major LLM APIs. More info in the 
[LiteLLM Docs](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers).

Dir-assistant uses a unique method for finding the most important files to include when submitting your
prompt to an LLM called CGRAG (Contextually Guided Retrieval-Augmented Generation). You can read 
[this blog post](https://medium.com/@djangoist/how-to-create-accurate-llm-responses-on-large-code-repositories-presenting-cgrag-a-new-feature-of-e77c0ffe432d) for more information about how it works.

This project runs local LLMs via the fantastic [llama-cpp-python](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python) package
and runs API LLMS using the also fantastic [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) package.

## New Features

* pipx support for Ubuntu 24.04
* Automatically disable CGRAG for filesets smaller than 4x the LLM context

## Quickstart

In this section are recipes to run `dir-assistant` in basic capacity to get you started quickly.

### Quickstart with Local Default Model (Phi 3 128k)

To get started locally, you can download a default llm model. Default configuration with this model requires 
11GB of memory on most hardware or 8GB on nvidia GPUs due to flash attention availability (enabled by default). 
You will be able to adjust the configuration to fit higher or lower memory requirements. To run via CPU:

```shell
pip install dir-assistant
dir-assistant models download-embed
dir-assistant models download-llm
cd directory/to/chat/with
dir-assistant
```

To run with hardware acceleration, use the `platform` subcommand:

```shell
...
dir-assistant platform cuda
cd directory/to/chat/with
dir-assistant
```

See which platforms are supported using `-h`:

```shell
dir-assistant platform -h
```

#### For Ubuntu 24.04

`pip3` has been replaced with `pipx` starting in Ubuntu 24.04.

```shell
pipx install dir-assistant
...
dir-assistant platform cuda --pipx
```

### Quickstart with API Model

To get started using an API model, you can use Google Gemini 1.5 Flash, which is currently free.
To begin, you need to sign up for [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) and 
[create an API key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey). After you create your API key,
enter the following commands:

```shell
pip install dir-assistant
dir-assistant models download-embed
dir-assistant setkey GEMINI_API_KEY xxxxxYOURAPIKEYHERExxxxx
cd directory/to/chat/with
dir-assistant
```

You can optionally hardware-accelerate your local embedding model so indexing is quicker:

```shell
...
dir-assistant platform cuda
cd directory/to/chat/with
dir-assistant
```

See which platforms are supported using `-h`:

```shell
dir-assistant platform -h
```

#### For Ubuntu 24.04

`pip3` has been replaced with `pipx` starting in Ubuntu 24.04.

```shell
pipx install dir-assistant
...
dir-assistant platform cuda --pipx
```

## Install

Install with pip:

```shell
pip install dir-assistant
```

The default configuration for `dir-assistant` is API-mode. If you download an LLM model with `download-llm`, 
local-mode will automatically be set. To change from API-mode to local-mode, set the `ACTIVE_MODEL_IS_LOCAL` setting.

#### For Ubuntu 24.04

`pip3` has been replaced with `pipx` starting in Ubuntu 24.04.

```shell
pipx install dir-assistant
```

## Embedding Model Download

You must download an embedding model regardless of whether you are running in local or API mode. You can
download a good default embedding model with:

```shell
dir-assistant models download-embed
```

If you would like to use another embedding model, open the models directory with:

```shell
dir-assistant models
```

Note: The embedding model will be hardware accelerated after using the `platform` subcommand. To disable
hardware acceleration, change `n_gpu_layers = -1` to `n_gpu_layers = 0` in the config.

## Optional: Select A Hardware Platform

By default `dir-assistant` is installed with CPU-only compute support. It will work properly without this step,
but if you would like to hardware accelerate `dir-assistant`, use the command below to compile 
`llama-cpp-python` with your hardware's support.

```shell
dir-assistant platform cuda
```

Available options: `cpu`, `cuda`, `rocm`, `metal`, `vulkan`, `sycl`

Note: The embedding model and the local llm model will be run with acceleration after selecting a platform. To disable 
hardware acceleration change `n_gpu_layers = -1` to `n_gpu_layers = 0` in the config.

#### For Ubuntu 24.04

`pip3` has been replaced with `pipx` starting in Ubuntu 24.04.

```shell
dir-assistant platform cuda --pipx
```

### For Platform Install Issues

System dependencies may be required for the `platform` command and are outside the scope of these instructions.

If you have any issues building `llama-cpp-python`, the project's install instructions may offer more 
info: https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python

## API Configuration

If you wish to use an API LLM, you will need to configure it. To configure which LLM API 
dir-assistant uses, you must edit `LITELLM_MODEL` and the appropriate API key in your configuration. To open 
your configuration file, enter:

```shell
dir-assistant config open
```

Once editing the file, change:

```toml
[DIR_ASSISTANT]
LITELLM_MODEL = "gemini/gemini-1.5-flash-latest"
LITELLM_CONTEXT_SIZE = 500000
...
[DIR_ASSISTANT.LITELLM_API_KEYS]
GEMINI_API_KEY = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

LiteLLM supports all major LLM APIs, including APIs hosted locally. View the available options in the 
[LiteLLM providers list](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers).

There is a convenience subcommand for modifying and adding API keys:

```shell
dir-assistant setkey GEMINI_API_KEY xxxxxYOURAPIKEYHERExxxxx
```

However, in most cases you will need to modify other options when changing APIs.

## Local LLM Model Download

If you want to use a local LLM, you can download a low requirements default model (Phi 3 128k) with:

```shell
dir-assistant models download-llm
```

Note: The local LLM model will be hardware accelerated after using the `platform` subcommand. To disable hardware
acceleration, change `n_gpu_layers = -1` to `n_gpu_layers = 0` in the config.

### Configuring A Custom Local Model

If you would like to use a custom local LLM model, download a GGUF model and place it in your models
directory. [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/models) has numerous GGUF models to choose from. The models 
directory can be opened in a file browser using this command:

```shell
dir-assistant models
```

After putting your gguf in the models directory, you must configure dir-assistant to use it:

```shell
dir-assistant config open
```

Edit the following setting:

```shell
[DIR_ASSISTANT]
LLM_MODEL = "Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407.Q6_K.gguf"
```

### Llama.cpp Options

Llama.cpp provides a large number of options to customize how your local model is run. Most of these options are
exposed via `llama-cpp-python`. You can configure them with the `[DIR_ASSISTANT.LLAMA_CPP_OPTIONS]`, 
`[DIR_ASSISTANT.LLAMA_CPP_EMBED_OPTIONS]`, and `[DIR_ASSISTANT.LLAMA_CPP_COMPLETION_OPTIONS]` sections in the 
config file.

The options available for `llama-cpp-python` are documented in the
[Llama constructor documentation](https://llama-cpp-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-reference/#llama_cpp.Llama).

What the options do is also documented in the 
[llama.cpp CLI documentation](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/master/examples/main/README.md).

The most important `llama-cpp-python` options are related to tuning the LLM to your system's VRAM:

* Setting `n_ctx` lower will reduce the amount of VRAM required to run, but will decrease the amount of 
file text that can be included when running a prompt.
* `CONTEXT_FILE_RATIO` sets the proportion of prompt history to file text to be included when sent to the LLM. 
Higher ratios mean more file text and less prompt history. More file text generally improves comprehension.
* If your llm `n_ctx` times `CONTEXT_FILE_RATIO` is smaller than your embed `n_ctx`, your file text chunks 
have the potential to be larger than your llm context, and thus will not be included. To ensure all files 
can be included, make sure your embed context is smaller than `n_ctx` times `CONTEXT_FILE_RATIO`.
* Larger embed `n_ctx` will chunk your files into larger sizes, which allows LLMs to understand them more
easily.
* `n_batch` must be smaller than the `n_ctx` of a model, but setting it higher will probably improve
performance.

For other tips about tuning Llama.cpp, explore their documentation and do some google searches.

## Running

```shell
dir-assistant
```

Running `dir-assistant` will scan all files recursively in your current directory. The most relevant files will 
automatically be sent to the LLM when you enter a prompt.

## Automated file update and git commit
The `COMMIT_TO_GIT` feature allows `dir-assistant` to make changes directly to your files and commit the changes to git
during the chat. By default, this feature is disabled, but after enabling it, the assistant will suggest file changes 
and ask whether to apply the changes. If confirmed, it stages the changes and creates a git commit with the prompt 
message as the commit message.

To enable the `COMMIT_TO_GIT` feature, update the configuration:

```shell
dir-assistant config open
```

Change or add the following setting:

```toml
[DIR_ASSISTANT]
...
COMMIT_TO_GIT = true
```

Once enabled, the assistant will handle the Git commit process as part of its workflow. To undo a commit,
type `undo` in the prompt.

## Running

```shell
dir-assistant
```
Running `dir-assistant` will scan all files recursively in your current directory. The most relevant files will 
automatically be sent to the LLM when you enter a prompt.

### Ignoring files

You can ignore files when starting up so they will not be included in the assistant's context:

```shell
dir-assistant -i file.txt
```

There is also a global ignore list in the config file. To configure it first open the config file:

```shell
dir-assistant config open
```

Then edit the setting:

```toml
[DIR_ASSISTANT]
...
GLOBAL_IGNORES = [
    ...
    "file.txt"
]
```
