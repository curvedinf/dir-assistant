# Dir Assistant Project Summary

## Overview

`dir-assistant` is a sophisticated command-line tool designed to let developers interact with their codebases using Large Language Models (LLMs). It operates directly within a project directory, recursively scanning files to build a contextual understanding. This enables a powerful chat-based interface where users can ask questions, request code modifications, and get insights about their project, all with the AI having direct access to the relevant file contents.

The tool is highly flexible, supporting both locally-run GGUF models via `llama-cpp-python` and a wide range of API-based models (like OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic) through the `LiteLLM` library.

## Core Features

- **Hybrid LLM Support:** Seamlessly switch between local models for privacy and offline use, and powerful API models for advanced tasks.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Intelligently finds and injects the most relevant snippets of code from the project into the LLM prompt, providing accurate, context-aware answers.
- **Advanced RAG Caching & Optimization:** A unique system that caches and reorders context based on historical usage patterns, significantly reducing latency and API costs for frequent, similar queries.
- **Interactive & Single-Prompt Modes:** Can be used as an ongoing interactive chat assistant or for one-off questions directly from the command line.
- **Live File Watching:** A background process monitors files for changes and automatically re-indexes them, ensuring the assistant's knowledge is always up-to-date.
- **Git Integration:** Can be configured to automatically generate and apply file changes, and then commit them to the repository with a user-provided message.
- **Contextually-Guided RAG (CGRAG):** An optional two-step process where an initial LLM call generates a more focused search query, improving the relevance of the retrieved context for the final answer.
- **Extensive Configuration:** A simple `config.toml` file allows fine-tuning of nearly every aspect, from system prompts and model parameters to RAG optimizer weights.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Python
- **LLM Integration:**
    - `llama-cpp-python` for local GGUF models.
    - `litellm` for API-based models.
- **Vector Search:** `faiss-cpu` for efficient RAG indexing and searching.
- **CLI Interface:** `argparse` for command parsing and `prompt-toolkit` for rich, multi-line input.
- **Configuration:** `dynaconf` and `toml` for flexible configuration management.
- **File System:** `watchdog` for live file monitoring.
- **Caching:** `sqlitedict` for persistent file indexing and RAG optimization caches.

## Architecture

The project follows a modular, inheritance-based structure centered around the `BaseAssistant` class.

-   **`main.py`**: The main entry point that handles argument parsing and dispatches commands to the appropriate modules (`start`, `config`, `models`, etc.).

-   **`cli/`**: Contains the logic for all command-line operations.
    -   `start.py`: Initializes the embedding and LLM models, creates the file index, and starts the main chat loop or single-prompt execution.
    -   `config.py`: Manages loading, saving, and defining default configurations.
    -   `models.py`: Provides helper functions to download and manage LLM/embedding models.

-   **`assistant/`**: The core logic of the AI assistant.
    -   **`base_assistant.py`**: The foundational class that implements core functionalities like RAG (`build_relevant_full_text`), history management (`cull_history_list`), and the main streaming chat loop.
    -   **`cgrag_assistant.py`**: Inherits from `BaseAssistant` and adds the two-step CGRAG logic.
    -   **`git_assistant.py`**: Inherits from `CGRAGAssistant` and adds the logic for creating diffs and committing to Git.
    -   **`llama_cpp_assistant.py` & `lite_llm_assistant.py`**: The final concrete classes inheriting from `GitAssistant`. They implement the `call_completion` and `count_tokens` methods specific to their respective LLM backends.
    -   **`index.py`**: Handles scanning for text files, chunking their content, generating embeddings, and building the `faiss` index.
    -   **`rag_optimizer.py`**: Implements the algorithm to re-rank RAG results based on historical usage, cache hits, and file stability.
    -   **`cache_manager.py`**: Manages the SQLite-based caches for prompt history and optimized prefixes.
